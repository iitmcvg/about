# Statement of Research

We are a student run organisation in the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras (IIT Madras). Formed in 2009, our aim is to use the technology in computer vision and artificial intelligence to create meaningful impact. Our work broadly revolves about applied research for impact projects- where we focus on specific issues which can be altered by this technology. Besides this, we work on active research in certain topics in computer vision, eg: drone imaging and computational photgraphy.
